# Cookie Clicker Automation

When main.py is run you can choose between opening the new Cookie Clicker or Cookie Clicker Classic.

New Cookie Clicker plays based on the increase in cookies per second(cps) so you just have to insert
how many cookie clicks per building purchase and how many building purchases per evaluation of the increase in cps.
Upgrades happen automatically. Why cps evaluation does not happen every purchase is because it's time consuming to check.

Cookie Clicker Classic simply buys the cheapest building. Only have to insert how many cookie clicks per purchase.
